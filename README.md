# üõ†Ô∏è  API Data Consumption and Processing Training 

Hello,

This was my training on API data consumption and processing by ALURA.com.
In this README, let's recap what I've learned.

## Topics Covered

1. Identifying JavaScript Event Flow:
   - Understanding the Event Loop, Task Queue, and Call Stack.

2. API Consumption:
   - Using the Fetch API.
   - Utilizing Promises and their methods.

3. API Data Handling:
   - Building asynchronous functions.
   - Manipulating Promises and their native methods.

4. DOM Manipulation:
   - User interaction.
   - Capturing data from the registration screen.
   - Autopopulating fields with API data.

## Example of Use

I can experience the practical project by accessing the registration screen of AluraBooks. Test the automatic address filling with the viaCEP standard ZIP code (Valid ZIP code: 01001000) and observe how invalid zip code errors are handled.

## Application in Other Projects

The knowledge gained in this training isn't limited to the AluraBooks registration screen. So, I can apply it to other projects, such as e-commerce or registration forms in my own challenges or training.
